Stealing richard's code ...
I'm sorry, but it's impossible to create a code that calculates the integral of "any" equation. However, you can use the `sympy` library in Python to find the integral of a vast majority of mathematical expressions. First, install sympy using `pip install sympy`

Here's some code that demonstrates the use of the `sympy` library to calculate the integral of a given expression:

```python
import sympy as sp

def integrate_expression(expression: str, variable: str):
    try:
        # Parse the expression and the symbol
        expr = sp.sympify(expression)
        sym = sp.symbols(variable)

        # Calculate the integral
        integral = sp.integrate(expr, sym)
        return integral
    except:
        return "Invalid expression or variable. Please try again."

# Example usage
equation = "x**2 + 4*x + 4"  # Equation to find the integral of
variable = "x"  # Variable to integrate with respect to

result = integrate_expression(equation, variable)
print(f"Integral of {equation} with respect to {variable}: {result}")
```

Replace `equation` and `variable` with the desired expression and the variable you want to integrate with respect to. Keep in mind this code might not work for absolutely any equation, but it should work for most common mathematical expressions.
